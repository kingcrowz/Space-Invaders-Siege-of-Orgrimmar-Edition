# Space-Invaders-Siege-of-Orgrimmar-Edition
this repository contains the code from an independent project I made in highschool.  Imagine something vaguely similar to space invaders but you instead are facing off against the might of garrosh hellscream.  All the power and equipment he has plundered from pandaria is coming for you.  Playing as the hunter hero 'Wilmer', you take aim to humble the aggressive warchief and sooth the emotions within him to stop the Sha from causing havoc.  **Please note that the images for this application are not uploaded to the repository at this time.  That will be done at a later date.
